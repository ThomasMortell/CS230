                This laboratory will be centred on the development of a Single Page Application (SPA), developed in PHP, that facilitates CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) management of a single database table held in a MySQL (or MariaDB) database. 
               
Assignment 4 :
                You are required to develop a Hiragana Tutor app, functioning as a single page application, that runs in a web browser. The app should provide functionality for saving and reviewing learner progress using AJAX calls to some accompanying database via a web service you have also created. You may use any learned technology to implement the app, the service, and the database, for example, you may choose to use HTML/CSS/JS (with jQuery) for the tutor app, and use PHP for the service, and MariaDB as the database. For this assignment, however, is essential that you use AJAX for communication between the app and the database for all persistent data storage.
